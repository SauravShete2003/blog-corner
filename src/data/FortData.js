    fortDescription:
      "Shivneri got its name as it was under the possession of the Yadavas of Devagiri. This fort was mainly used to guard the old trading route from Desh to the port city of Kalyan. The place passed on to the Bahmani Sultanate after the weakening of Delhi Sultanate during the 15th century and it then passed on to the Ahmadnagar Sultanate in the 16th century. In 1595, a Maratha chief named Maloji Bhosale, the grandfather of Shivaji Maharaj Bhosale, was ennobled by the Ahmadnagar Sultan, Bahadur Nizam Shah and he gave him Shivneri and Chakan. Shivaji Maharaj was born at the fort on 19 February 1630 (some accounts place it 1627), and spent his childhood there. Inside the fort is a small temple dedicated to goddess Shivai Devi,[2] after whom Shivaji was named. The English traveller Fraze visited the fort in 1673 and found it invincible. According to his accounts, the fort was well-stocked to feed thousand families for seven years. The fort came under the control of the British rule in 1819 after the Third Anglo-Maratha War",

      "The Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj assigned Moropant Trimbak Pingle, his prime minister, to undertake the construction of this fort in order to defend the banks of the Nira and the Koyna rivers, and to defend the Par pass. It was completed in 1656.[5][6]The Battle of Pratapgad between Shivaji and Afzal Khan, a general of Adil Shahi dynasty, was fought below the ramparts of this fort on 10 November 1659. This was the first major test of the fledgling kingdoms army and set the stage of the establishment of the Maratha empire.Pratapgad continued to be involved in regional politics.[until when?] Sakharam Bapu Bokil, a well-known minister of Pune, was confined by his rival Nana Phadnis in Pratapgad in 1778. He was later moved from fort to fort until he died at Raigad. In 1796, Nana Phadnis, while escaping from the intrigues of Daulatrao Shinde and his minister Baloba, assembled a strong garrison in Pratapgad before heading to Mahad. In 1818, as part of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Pratapgad was surrendered to the East India company.",

      "Literally meaning lions fort, Sinhagad Fort is strategically located on a cliff on the Bhuleshwar range of the Sahyadri mountains, about 1,312 m above sea level. Experts have determined that it was built 1,500-2,000 years ago. An intimidating fortress, it was considered virtually impenetrable; the steep slopes ensured it was difficult for the enemy to approach it. Today, of course, there is a motorable road leading up to the fort. The fort has two notable gateways: in the northeastern part and in the southeastern part, called the Pune Darwaza and the Kalyan Darwaza. The ruins of the fort speak volumes about its grand history when it was a major fortification of legendary Maratha ruler, Shivaji. From the fort, one can get sweeping views of the surrounding areas. Located about 30 km from Pune, this fort was earlier known as Kondana. It is home to a bust of Tanaji Malusare, built in memory of his resistance of the Mughals. Tourists can also head to Rajaram s tomb, the military depot, breweries etc. The Kali Temple and the Hanuman effigy are gems that have been preserved from the ancient days. Enjoy the scenic views of the city, the many forts and the Sahyadri mountains as you dig into pitlabhakari, a local speciality.",
